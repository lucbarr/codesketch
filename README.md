# Code Sketch

Simple platform to teach C and C++ easily.

*Still in development*

## Idea

The basic idea is that a proper environment eases learning your first
programming language.

Since C/C++ is sometimes the first programming language in many universities, I,
as a self taught programmer, gathered the learning difficulties students have in
the very beginning and tried to solve them all with this platform. The issues I
noticed are:

- No visual feedback
- Too many lines for very basic programs
- Too many library includes for very basic programs
- Very mechanical and little creative

So, the usual programming learning environment seems to discourage students
instead of motivating them. Of course many still love from the very beginning,
but why not the majority of them?

Using the [Processing](https://processing.org) idea, as a flexible software
sketchbook, I'm developing a C/C++ sketchbook, named **Code Sketch**.
